🧩 Handling Missing Data via KNN Imputation
Smart Imputation for Better Model Performance

A practical comparison of advanced vs. basic missing data strategies — using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation to preserve data structure and improve machine learning accuracy, benchmarked against simple mean-based imputation.

✅ Ideal for real-world datasets where missing values are common and naive filling can hurt model performance.

📌 Overview
This project explores how different approaches to handling missing data impact the predictive power of machine learning models. Using a real-world shipping dataset, it compares KNN imputation — which leverages relationships between features — against simple mean imputation, a common but less sophisticated baseline.

The notebook follows a complete machine learning pipeline:

📥 Data Loading & Preparation: Import the dataset and remove irrelevant columns (e.g., categorical identifiers not useful for modeling)
🔍 Missing Data Assessment: Quantify the extent of missingness to understand the challenge
✂️ Train-Test Splitting: Separate data before any imputation to prevent data leakage
🧽 Imputation Strategies:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• KNN Imputation: Fills missing values by learning from similar records in the feature space
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Simple (Mean) Imputation: Replaces missing entries with column averages
📊 Model Training & Comparison: Train a Logistic Regression model on both imputed datasets and compare their accuracy
🌲 Extended Validation: Test the KNN-imputed data with a Random Forest classifier for robustness
🔁 Cross-Validation: Use 5-fold cross-validation to obtain a reliable, stable estimate of model performance

📥 Installation
All required libraries can be installed with pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

💡 Tip: KNN imputation works best when features are on similar scales — consider standardization for optimal results.

📁 Dataset
The analysis uses Ship_Dataset.csv, which includes:

Completed: Binary target variable (e.g., 1 = shipment completed, 0 = not completed)
Worker_Used: Numerical feature with missing values (primary focus for imputation)
Compartment: Additional numerical feature
Country: Categorical column dropped early in preprocessing (not used in modeling)
✨ Why KNN Imputation?
Unlike mean imputation — which ignores feature relationships — KNN imputation uses the multivariate structure of your data. By finding the most similar records, it fills gaps in a way that respects underlying patterns, often leading to more accurate models.

🎯 Key Insight
The results show how thoughtful imputation directly influences model quality. KNN imputation typically outperforms simple methods, especially when missingness is not random and features are correlated.
